	abstract = {Cross-linking mass spectrometry has matured to a frequently used tool for the investigation of protein structures as well as interactome studies up to a system-wide level. The growing community generated a broad spectrum of applications, linker types, acquisition strategies and specialized data analysis tools, which makes it challenging to decide for an appropriate analysis workflow. Here, we report a large and flexible synthetic peptide library as reliable instrument to benchmark crosslink workflows. Additionally, we provide a tool, IMP-X-FDR, that calculates the real, experimentally validated, FDR, compares results across search engine platforms and analyses crosslink properties in an automated manner. We apply the library with 6 commonly used linker reagents and analyse the data with 6 established search engines. We thereby show that the correct algorithm and search setting choice is highly important to improve identification rate and reliability. We reach identification rates of up to {\textasciitilde}70 \% of the theoretical maximum (i.e. 700 unique lysine-lysine cross-links) while maintaining a real false-discovery-rate of {\textless}3 \% at cross-link level with high reproducibility, representatively showing that our test system delivers valuable and statistically solid results.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Knowledge of elaborate structures of protein complexes is fundamental for understanding their functions and regulations. Although cross-linking coupled with mass spectrometry (MS) has been presented as a feasible strategy for structural elucidation of large multisubunit protein complexes, this method has proven challenging because of technical difficulties in unambiguous identification of cross-linked peptides and determination of cross-linked sites by MS analysis. In this work, we developed a novel cross-linking strategy using a newly designed MS-cleavable cross-linker, disuccinimidyl sulfoxide (DSSO). DSSO contains two symmetric collision-induced dissociation (CID)-cleavable sites that allow effective identification of DSSO-cross-linked peptides based on their distinct fragmentation patterns unique to cross-linking types (\textit{i.e.} interlink, intralink, and dead end). The CID-induced separation of interlinked peptides in MS/MS permits MS$^{\textrm{3}}$ analysis of single peptide chain fragment ions with defined modifications (due to DSSO remnants) for easy interpretation and unambiguous identification using existing database searching tools. Integration of data analyses from three generated data sets (MS, MS/MS, and MS$^{\textrm{3}}$) allows high confidence identification of DSSO cross-linked peptides. The efficacy of the newly developed DSSO-based cross-linking strategy was demonstrated using model peptides and proteins. In addition, this method was successfully used for structural characterization of the yeast 20 S proteasome complex. In total, 13 non-redundant interlinked peptides of the 20 S proteasome were identified, representing the first application of an MS-cleavable cross-linker for the characterization of a multisubunit protein complex. Given its effectiveness and simplicity, this cross-linking strategy can find a broad range of applications in elucidating the structural topology of proteins and protein complexes.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Crosslinking-mass spectrometry (XL-MS) serves to identify interaction sites between proteins. Numerous search engines for crosslink identification exist, but lack of ground truth samples containing known crosslinks has precluded their systematic validation. Here we report on XL-MS data arising from measuring synthetic peptide libraries that provide the unique benefit of knowing which identified crosslinks are true and which are false. The data are analysed with the most frequently used search engines and the results filtered to an estimated false discovery rate of 5\%. We find that the actual false crosslink identification rates range from 2.4 to 32\%, depending on the analysis strategy employed. Furthermore, the use of MS-cleavable crosslinkers does not reduce the false discovery rate compared to non-cleavable crosslinkers. We anticipate that the datasets acquired during this research will further drive optimisation and development of XL-MS search engines, thereby advancing our understanding of vital biological interactions.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Chemical cross-linking mass spectrometry identifies interacting surfaces within a protein assembly through labeling with bifunctional reagents and identifying the covalently modified peptides. These yield distance constraints that provide a powerful means to model the three-dimensional structure of the assembly. Bioinformatic analysis of cross-linked data resulting from large protein assemblies is challenging because each cross-linked product contains two covalently linked peptides, each of which must be correctly identified from a complex matrix of potential confounders.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}Protein Prospector addresses these issues through a complementary mass modification strategy in which each peptide is searched and identified separately. We demonstrate this strategy with an analysis of RNA polymerase II. False discovery rates (FDRs) are assessed via comparison of cross-linking data to crystal structure, as well as by using a decoy database strategy. Parameters that are most useful for positive identification of cross-linked spectra are explored. We find that fragmentation spectra generally contain more product ions from one of the two peptides constituting the cross-link. Hence, metrics reflecting the quality of the spectral match to the less confident peptide provide the most discriminatory power between correct and incorrect matches. A support vector machine model was built to further improve classification of cross-linked peptide hits. Furthermore, the frequency with which peptides cross-linked via common acylating reagents fragment to produce diagnostic, cross-linker-specific ions is assessed.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}The threshold for successful identification of the cross-linked peptide product depends upon the complexity of the sample under investigation. Protein Prospector, by focusing the reliability assessment on the least confident peptide, is better able to control the FDR for results as larger complexes and databases are analyzed. In addition, when FDR thresholds are calculated separately for intraprotein and interprotein results, a further improvement in the number of unique cross-links confidently identified is achieved. These improvements are demonstrated on two previously published cross-linking datasets.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},
