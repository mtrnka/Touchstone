Description: Touchstone provides methods for automated classification of Protein
  Prospector Crosslinking Mass Spectrometry (CLMS) search results at a desired 
  False Discovery Rate (FDR). CLMS results can be summarized at the CSM, residue-pair,
  peptide-pair, or protein-pair levels and FDR is controlled at the desired stage.
  Touchstone builds a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier for rescoring 
  Protein Prospector output that significantly outperforms metrics present in the
  Prospector Search Compare report. Touchstone can read an optional Module file which
  enables annoation and summariziation of Macromolecular Modules (comprising multiple proteins) or Domains
  (regions within a protein). Furthermore the module file can contain links to high
  resoluton structure files (pdb/cif) to enable measumrent of C$\alpha$-C$\alpha$ 
  distances spanned by crosslinks.
